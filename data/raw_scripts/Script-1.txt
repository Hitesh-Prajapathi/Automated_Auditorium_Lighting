FADE IN:

INT. OLD VICTORIAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

[Approx. Timestamp: 00:00:00]
Rain lashes the windows. EMMA (32, tired single mom) sits on a worn couch, scrolling her phone. Her daughter LILY (8) sleeps upstairs. The house creaks—old pipes, settling wood.

EMMA
(soft, to herself)
Just one more bill paid... then bed.

A faint WHISPER from the wall behind her. Indistinct. She freezes.

EMMA
Hello?

Silence. She shakes it off, stands, walks to the kitchen.

CUT TO:

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

[Approx. Timestamp: 00:01:30]
Emma pours water. The whisper again—closer, like breath on her neck.

WHISPER (O.S.)
...stay...

Emma spins. Nothing. She laughs nervously.

EMMA
Old house. Just the wind.

She heads upstairs.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

[Approx. Timestamp: 00:03:00]
Emma checks on Lily. The girl is peaceful, clutching a stuffed bear. Emma kisses her forehead.

EMMA
(whispering)
Sweet dreams, baby.

As she turns to leave, the bedroom door creaks shut behind her—slowly, on its own. Emma stops.

EMMA
Lily?

No answer. She pushes the door open. Lily is gone. Bed empty.

EMMA
(panicked)
Lily!

She rushes downstairs.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

[Approx. Timestamp: 00:05:00]
Emma searches frantically. Calls out.

EMMA
Lily! This isn't funny!

The whispers grow—multiple voices now, overlapping, childlike but wrong.

WHISPERS (O.S.)
...she's ours now... she likes it here...

Emma grabs her phone— no signal. She runs to the front door. Locked. She twists the knob violently.

EMMA
Open! Come on!

The lights flicker. Shadows stretch unnaturally long across the walls.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT

[Approx. Timestamp: 00:07:30]
Emma, flashlight in hand, descends slowly. The whispers lead her down.

WHISPERS
...down here... she's waiting...

At the bottom: the basement is empty except for an old mirror covered in dust. Emma approaches.

She wipes the glass. Her reflection stares back—but it's not moving with her. The reflection smiles.

REFLECTION EMMA
(soft, eerie)
You've been gone so long, Emma. We missed you.

Emma backs away. The mirror cracks—slow spiderweb fractures.

Suddenly, LILY'S VOICE from behind the mirror.

LILY (O.S.)
Mommy... help...

Emma smashes the mirror with her elbow. Glass shatters. Darkness swallows the room.

The whispers become screams—inhuman.

EMMA
(screaming)
Give her back!

Blackout. Only the sound of rain... and one last whisper.

WHISPER (O.S.)
...she's home now...

FADE OUT.
