INT. BUS TERMINAL – EARLY MORNING

[00:00:00]

The terminal is quiet. Morning light filters through dusty glass. A few passengers sit scattered.

ARUN (29) sits alone, holding a small backpack. He checks his phone. No messages.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – CONTINUOUS

[00:02:00]

NISHA (27) enters, scanning the terminal. She notices Arun and stops.

NISHA
You didn’t tell me you were leaving today.

ARUN
I didn’t think you’d come.

NISHA
That makes two of us.

They stand in silence.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – SEATING AREA

[00:04:30]

They sit on opposite ends of the bench.

NISHA
How long?

ARUN
A year. Maybe more.

NISHA
You always say “maybe” when you already know.

Arun looks away.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – COFFEE STALL

[00:07:00]

Arun hands Nisha a paper cup.

ARUN
You still drink it without sugar?

NISHA
Some habits survive everything.

She sips. Winces.

NISHA (CONT’D)
Still terrible.

He smiles faintly.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – WAITING AREA

[00:09:30]

A bus announcement echoes faintly.

NISHA
Do you remember when we planned to leave together?

ARUN
We were younger. Braver.

NISHA
Or just unaware.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – CONTINUOUS

[00:12:00]

People begin to gather.

NISHA
Say it clearly. Why are you really going?

ARUN
Because staying started to feel like pretending.

NISHA
Pretending what?

ARUN
That I was enough here.

She absorbs this.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – WINDOW SIDE

[00:14:30]

Sunlight grows brighter.

NISHA
I waited for you to choose us.

ARUN
I was scared I’d ruin it.

NISHA
You did. By not choosing.

Silence.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – ANNOUNCEMENT AREA

[00:17:00]

The departure announcement plays again.

ARUN
I didn’t come here to fix things.

NISHA
Good. Some things shouldn’t be fixed. Just understood.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – SEATING AREA

[00:19:30]

Nisha pulls a folded note from her bag.

NISHA
I wrote this last year.
I never sent it.

She hands it to Arun.

He doesn’t open it.

ARUN
I’ll read it later.

NISHA
That’s exactly why I’m giving it now.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – CONTINUOUS

[00:22:00]

Arun finally opens the note. Reads silently.

ARUN
You always knew me better than I knew myself.

NISHA
That was the problem.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – BOARDING GATE

[00:24:30]

Passengers line up.

Arun stands.

ARUN
I don’t expect you to wait.

NISHA
I’m not good at waiting anymore.

They share a small, honest smile.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – GATE ENTRANCE

[00:27:00]

Arun hesitates.

ARUN
If I come back—

NISHA
Don’t finish that sentence.

He nods.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – CONTINUOUS

[00:29:30]

Arun steps forward, then turns back.

ARUN
Thank you.
For not making this harder.

NISHA
Thank you for finally being clear.

INT. BUS TERMINAL – FINAL MOMENT

[00:32:00]

Arun boards the bus.

Through the window, Nisha watches.

The bus pulls away.

Nisha remains still.

She exhales — not sad, not relieved — just lighter.

FADE OUT

[00:34:00]
