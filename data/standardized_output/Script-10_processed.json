Because he \ntold you he didn't like a play that everyone thought was shitty?\nAlan I think it rekindled the rivalry weve had for years. Patrick and I have always \ncompetedfor everything, including girls. I remember once in secondary school\nEve  Whatever. What happened?\nAlan  It came to blows. He slipped and hit his head on a corner of the table.\nEve The amount of blood on his shirt would indicate a sharp object was involved, \nrather than blunt force trauma.\nAlan Blood was pouring out of every orifice. Eyes, nose, ears. He convulsed for 15 \nminutes at least.

Nothing looks more like a \nbike than another bike, don't you think?\nEve  Yes Sure\nEmma  And Alan?\nEve Yes, yes, he's here, but he's working. On his new play. And you know him, \nwhen he's writing\nEmma I understand Especially since his last play was such a failure What was \nit called again?\nEve  Hiroshima.\nEmma  That's right. No wonder it bombed. \nEve  Surely that's not what you wanted to talk to me about\n9\n\nEmma I'm really sorry to bother you. I know it's not the right time, but it's \nimportant.\nEve But of course! It's no bother at all, that's what friends are for Do you want \nsomething to drink?\nEmma  No thank you I'm OK\nEve Good(Emma looks at her, surprised.) No, I mean Please, sit down \n(Emma is about to sit on the sofa, next to the cushion hiding the shirt.)

So, what is it that you wanted to tell me that's so \nimportant?\nEmma So You're not going to believe this I just found out Patrick was \ncheating on me.\nEve  Really? And you didn't know?\nEmma  Well no. Why, did you?\nEve  But of course not!

What matters is that he's cheating on \nyou.\nEmma Yes Well yes, you're right. But it would be worse if he cheated with \nsomeone I know.\nEve  Yeah\nEmma Can you imagine? Finding out your husband is cheating on you with your \nbest friend?\nEve  What? What are you talking about?\nEmma  No, don't worry.

Maybe \nit was an accident\nEmma An accident? What do you mean? Do you think people hit on each other by \nmistake? Absentmindedly? And when things get hot and heavy, they just call the \ninsurance company and let them sort it out?\nEve  No, of course not, but\nEmma And then, when he comes home, the guy casually says to his wife: oh, by \nthe way, I meant to tell you, I had a little accident, I rear-ended the neighbour's wife.\nEve  He rear-ended the neighbour's wife?\nEmma No, but I'm just saying! It's an example. Are you sure you're OK? This story \nseems to be upsetting you more than me.\nEve I'm worried about you. As a couple you were so When we said Patrick and \nEmma, it was\nEmma  Like saying Alan and Eve.\nEve  So now when you tell me you're breaking up\nEmma  Goes to show Nothing lasts forever.\nEve  That's true, even Adam and Eve couldn't get their happy ever after.\nEmma Well, in any case, I'm never sleeping under the same roof as that bastard \never again. \nEve  I understand, of course\nEmma  And I can count on you for my divorce, right?\nEve Are you sure?
